# AI Block

AI Block is a Firefox browser extension that blocks unproductive websites using AI. This project demonstrates integrating AI with browser extensions to help students and programmers stay focused.

## Purpose

The extension uses a large language model of your choice to analyze the content and block websites that are not productive. It helps users avoid distractions and maintain focus on important tasks.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Blocking**: Uses a local language model server with an OpenAI-compatible API to decide if a website should be blocked based on its content and URL.
- **Content Analysis**: Analyzes the main content of the webpage to make blocking decisions.
- **Caching**: Caches AI decisions to improve performance and reduce redundant API calls.
- **Timeout Mechanism**: Checks if the user stays on the page for more than 5 seconds before making a blocking decision.

## Future Work

This is just a rough sketch / MVP of an idea. Future work may include, but is not limited to:

- **Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements**: Improving stability and efficiency.
- **Prompt Fine-Tuning**: Enhancing AI model prompts for better accuracy.
